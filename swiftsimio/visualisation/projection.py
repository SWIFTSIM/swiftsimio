    Creates a 2D projection of a SWIFT dataset, projected by the "project"
    variable (e.g. if project is Temperature, we return: \bar{T} = \sum_j T_j
    W_{ij}).

    Default projection variable is mass. If it is None, then we don't
    weight with anything, providing a number density image.

    Parameters
    ----------

    data: __SWIFTParticleDataset
        The SWIFT dataset that you wish to visualise (get this from ``load``)

    boxsize: unyt_array
        The box-size of the simulation.

    resolution: int
        The resolution of the image. All images returned are square, ``res``
        by ``res``, pixel grids.

    project: str, optional
        Variable to project to get the weighted density of. By default, this
        is mass. If you would like to mass-weight any other variable, you can
        always create it as ``data.gas.my_variable = data.gas.other_variable
        * data.gas.masses``.

    region: unyt_array, optional
        Region, determines where the image will be created (this corresponds
        to the left and right-hand edges, and top and bottom edges) if it is
        not None. It should have a length of four or six, and take the form:
        ``[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, {z_min, z_max}]``

    mask: np.array, optional
        Allows only a sub-set of the particles in data to be visualised. Useful
        in cases where you have read data out of a ``velociraptor`` catalogue,
        or if you only want to visualise e.g. star forming particles. This boolean
        mask is applied just before visualisation.

    rotation_center: np.array, optional
        Center of the rotation. If you are trying to rotate around a galaxy, this
        should be the most bound particle.

    rotation_matrix: np.array, optional
        Rotation matrix (3x3) that describes the rotation of the box around
        ``rotation_center``. In the default case, this provides a projection
        along the z axis.

    parallel: bool, optional
        Defaults to ``False``, whether or not to create the image in parallel.
        The parallel version of this function uses significantly more memory.

    backend: str, optional
        Backend to use. See documentation for details. Defaults to 'fast'.


    Returns
    -------

    image: unyt_array
        Projected image with units of project / length^2, of size ``res`` x ``res``.


    Notes
    -----

    + Particles outside of this range are still considered if their smoothing
      lengths overlap with the range.
    + The returned array has x as the first component and y as the second component,
      which is the opposite to what ``imshow`` requires. You should transpose the
      array if you want it to be visualised the 'right way up'.
