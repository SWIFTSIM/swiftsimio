SWIFTsimIO Changelog
====================

v 2.4.0
-------

Units and internal updates. Changes:

+ Removed unnecessary call to `tqdm` inside smoothing length generation
  module.
+ Added `to_physical` and `convert_to_physical` methods to `cosmo_array`.
+ Added math operators to `cosmo_factor`
+ `swiftsimio` now converts internal units from cgs-based units to the
  closest 'sensible' value to prevent underflows in image making.

v 2.3.0
-------

Masking visualisation update. Changes:

+ The order of parameters in ``projection`` visualisation
  functions has changed, to make more logical sense.
+ A new argument in ``projection`` allows for the
  projection of sub-sets of particles, ``mask``. See
  the documentation for more details.

v 2.2.0
-------

Visualisation update! Includes:

+ New ability to generate rotation matrices from vectors.
+ Projection plots can now be made with arbitrary rotations.

v 2.1.1
-------

Minor bugfix, including:

+ Fixed an error in indexing syntax that meant cells were not correctly
  reading particles from a file.
+ Fixed an error where when using SWIFTMask, where reading arrays would
  crash if there was not a particle of a given type in a top-level cell.
+ Changed the ReadTheDocs theme.

v 2.1.0
-------

Minor updates, including:

+ Added badge to link to documentation to README.
+ Significant performance improvements for reading chunks from HDF5 files.
+ Visualisation bug fix where box-size was overflowing.
+ Now support dithered top-level cell mesh for reading partial snapshots.
+ Added `wily` as an optional requirement for development.
+ Use `Solar_Mass` in units instead of `msun` as it is a 'first-class' unit.

v 2.0.0
-------

The `v2` update! This includes a huge laundry list of changes.

+ Added stellar smoothing lengths to output from the `swiftsimio` generated initial
  conditions.
+ Added smoothing length generation code to ensure that smoothing lengths can
  be made for dark matter.
+ Enabled projection images for all particle types through `project_pixel_grid`.
+ Added `msun` as a first-class unit in `unyt` such that things can be converted
  to it much more easily.
+ Added region selection to rendering so that users can select to render only a
  specific portion of the box instead of the whole thing.
+ Added a large amount of automated tests for the rendering suite.
+ Added the `__version__` attribute to `swiftsimio` for convenience.
+ Added a new `swiftsimio.optional_packages` sub-module to enable use of new
  optional packages throughout the code, in a similar fashion to the 
  `swiftsimio.accelerated` sub-module.
+ Added a huge amount of new documentation.


v 1.2.0
-------

The `py-sphviewer` integration update!

+ Adds a new sub-module, `swiftsimio.visualisation.sphviewer`, that
  provides inter-operability with py-sphviewer.


v 1.1.0
-------

The parallel update!

+ Adds parallel visualisation routines for all projection, slice, and volume
  rendering options. This can be activated by using the `parallel=True` argument.
+ Upgraded to `unyt` version 2.3.0 or above. This allows us to stay on track with
  `unyt` as previously we required an older version.

v 1.0.3
-------

Boundary particles bugfix

+ Fixes a bug preventing snapshots that include boundary particles from being used
  with cell masking.

v 1.0.2
-------

Visualisation bugfix

+ A botched merge left some incorrect code in visualisation. This is now fixed.

v 1.0.1
-------

Temperature bugfix

+ A check in the code for dimensionless quantities was accidentally picking up temperatures as also
  being dimensionless. This is now fixed.


v 1.0.0
-------

Major breaking changes ahead!

This update adds:

+ Metadata directly copied out of the snapshots
+ Ability to add new particle fields without needing to update `swiftsimio`
+ Breaks backwards compatiblity with older versions of SWIFT (require v>0.9.0)

v 0.8.0
-------

Adds volume rendering (BETA)!

+ Adds a new (hidden) volume render mode, in `visualisation.volume_render`
+ Bugfixes for kernel implementations.

v 0.7.0
-------

Added extra boundary particles!

+ Two new particle types, `boundary` and `second_boundary`, for zoom-in simulations.

v 0.6.0
-------

Basic slice image functionality!

+ Added some more imaging code that now creates slice plots. Again, this is
  mainly useful for making movies. You'll want to use `yt` or py-sphviewer for
  more complex things.
+ Internally, we moved the visualisation stuff to a sub-module.
+ Minor bug-fixes in the imaging code to do with kernel normalization.

v 0.5.0
-------

Basic image-creation functionality!

+ Added some (super fast) routines to make projections of the whole box. This is
  only useful for simple projections of the whole box and is not thread parallel.
  In particular, it's useful for making movies.

v 0.4.0
-------

User-defined particle types update!

+ Allows for user defined particle types through an API
+ Adds the RunName field.

v 0.3.8
-------

Dependency release:

+ Explicitly makes `unyt<2.0.0` an install requirement.

v 0.3.7
-------

Cooling release:

+ Added RadiatedEnergy -> radiated_energy field.
+ Fixes some issues with information from the diffusion.

v 0.3.6
-------

Urgent bugfix release:

+ Fixed incorrect parsing of dual-purpose metadata.

v 0.3.5
-------

Another bugfix release. This fixes the following errors:

+ Missing variables from metadata that were re-using dictionary keys
+ Fixed `a` always being set to 1.0
+ Added a number of unit tests
+ Actually added correct travis integration.

v 0.3.4
-------

Major bugfixes:

+ Fake jit decorator was incorrectly called in accelerate.py
+ Incorrect metadata

v 0.3.3
-------

Star formation update:

+ Includes some new names for fields that have changed recently in
  the star formation code in SWIFT.

v 0.3.2
-------

ANARCHY update:

+ Added diffusion and viscosity coefficients to the reading metadata

v 0.3.1
-------

The masking performance update:

+ Use `np.take` with integer masks instead of boolean masks for significantly
  improved performance.
+ Major bugfixes to the spatial matching code.

v 0.3.0
-------

The masking update:

+ Added masking object and functions (both spatial and property-based).
+ Added units to relevant unpacked header variables.
+ Added nicer API to access (base) units.
+ Added `present_particle_types property` to metadata.

v 0.2.3
-------

Backwards-compatibility update:

+ Write "NumFilesPerSnapshot", "NumPart_ThisFile", and "MassTable" to snapshots.
+ Added ability to write extra items to the header.

v 0.2.2
-------

Minor bugfixes and improvements:

+ Added the MaterialID field
+ Changed internal energy units to be correct (energy per unit mass).

v 0.2.1
-------

Documentation update!

+ Includes significantly more documentation for how to create initial conditions
  files with `swiftsimio`.
+ Minor bugfixes throughout.
+ Added `swiftsimio.validate_file` to validate your dataset is a SWIFT output
  file before reading.
+ Added a number of metadata properties to the reader for pretty-printing code
  information: `compiler_info`, `library_info`, `hydro_info`, `viscosity_info`,
  `code_info`
+ Added ability to automatically generate smoothing lengths for gas datasets
  in the writer.

v 0.2.0
-------

First writer update:

+ Implements writer functionality. This allows for an object-oriented API to be
  used to create SWIFT IC files.
+ Compatibility changes in the reader to work with self-generated initial
  conditions files.
+ Minor bugfixes.

v 0.1.2
-------

Fixed a minor packaging bug.

v 0.1.1
-------

First minor revision:

+ Fixes a minor packaging issue
+ Implements some boilerplate for upcoming features

v 0.1.0
-------

The first version of the code includes the following:

+ Basic reader functionality implemented
+ `unyt` arrays used for reading data
+ Data read dynamically from snapshot
+ Some basic parsing of header information
+ EAGLE chemistry reader included.
