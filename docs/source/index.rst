   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to SWIFTsimIO's documentation!
======================================

``swiftsimio`` is a toolkit for reading SWIFT_ data, an astrophysics
simulation code. It is used to ensure that everything that you read has a
symbolic unit attached, and  can be used for visualisation. The final key
feature that it enables is the use of the cell metadata in ``SWIFT``
snapshots to enable partial reading.

Citing SWIFTsimIO
=================

Please cite ``swiftsimio`` using the JOSS paper_:

.. code-block:: bibtex

    @article{Borrow2020,
      doi = {10.21105/joss.02430},
      url = {https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02430},
      year = {2020},
      publisher = {The Open Journal},
      volume = {5},
      number = {52},
      pages = {2430},
      author = {Josh Borrow and Alexei Borrisov},
      title = {swiftsimio: A Python library for reading SWIFT data},
      journal = {Journal of Open Source Software}
    }
    
If you use any of the subsampled projection backends, we ask that you cite our relevant
SPHERIC article_. Note that citing the arXiv version here is recommended as the ADS
cannot track conference proceedings well.
