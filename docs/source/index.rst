Welcome to SWIFTsimIO's documentation!
======================================

``SWIFTsimIO`` is a toolkit for reading SWIFT_ data, an astrophysics
simulation code. It is used to ensure that everything that you read has a
symbolic unit attached, and  can be used for visualisation. The final key
feature that it enables is the use of the cell metadata in ``SWIFT``
snapshots to enable partial reading.
